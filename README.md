Patient Appointment System - FullStack Developer Challenge
Welcome to my submission for the FullStack Developer Challenge! This project is a Patient Appointment System designed to streamline the process of managing patients, scheduling appointments, and handling payments.

Tech Stack:
SQL (Relational Database)
FastAPI (Backend)
Frontend Website (React)
Problem Statement:
The Patient Appointment System offers a range of functionalities:

Create Patient: Users can easily add new patients to the system, providing essential details such as name, mobile number, and email.
List Patients: The system features a dashboard that displays a comprehensive list of all patients.
Search Functionality: Users can quickly search for patients by name on the dashboard, enhancing efficiency.
View Patient: Detailed patient profiles are accessible, providing a comprehensive overview of each patient's information, along with linked appointments.
Create Appointment: Users have the ability to schedule appointments for patients, with associated appointment details visible within the patient profile.
Stripe Integration: The system seamlessly integrates with Stripe to generate payment links for each appointment, simplifying the payment process for users.
Bonus Points:
In addition to the core functionalities, I've implemented the following bonus features:

OAuth 2.0 Implementation: OAuth 2.0 authentication has been integrated into the system, allowing users to log in securely using their preferred provider, such as GitHub or Google.
Deployment: The application has been successfully deployed to the cloud, leveraging the capabilities of AWS for seamless accessibility.
How to Run the Code:
Backend (FastAPI):
Navigate to the backend directory.
Activate the virtual environment using the following command:
        **. venv/Scripts/activate**
Run the FastAPI server with the following command:
      **uvicorn api.main:app --reload**
Frontend (React):
Navigate to the frontend directory.
Run the frontend server using the following command:
      **npm start**
Accessing the Application:
After following the above steps, the backend will be running on a specified port (usually 8000), and the frontend will be running on another port (usually 3000).
Access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000 for the frontend.
Ensure that both backend and frontend servers are running simultaneously to utilize the full functionality of the application.
Submission Details:
I have committed the code to a public GitHub repository, along with comprehensive instructions for running the application locally. You can access the repository here (https://github.com/ManiishJangidDev/patient_appointment).
